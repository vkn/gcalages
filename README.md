add current age to google calendar entries, having birth year in event title: e.g. 2, bob marley, 2011

Google Calendar does not display current age of birthday child. My solution (just for fun and learning java):

create calendar entry with name + birthday year information. e.g. max mustermann, 2000. The application
accepts google credentials and optional calendar feed address, if birthdays stored not in main calendar. 

Given that we prepend current age to the entry title:  13, max mustermann, 2000. Existing age will be replaced.
